      " Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke For Threatening To Poke People â€˜In The Eyeâ€™,\"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet. I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me,  the former sheriff tweeted.  I will continue to poke them in the eye with a sharp stick and bitch slap these scum bags til they get it. I have been attacked by better people than them #MAGA I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me.

Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD. Nothing gets a bully like LYING LIB MEDIA S attention better than to give them a taste of their own blood #neverbackdown pic.twitter.com/T2NY2psHCR  David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) December 30, 2017The internet called him out.This is your local newspaper and that search warrant isn t fake, and just because the chose not to file charges at the time doesn t mean they won t! Especially if you continue to lie. Months after decision not to charge Clarke, email search warrant filed https://t.co/zcbyc4Wp5b  KeithLeBlanc (@KeithLeBlanc63) December 30, 2017I just hope the rest of the Village People aren t implicated.

      "On Monday, a senior government official sparked outrage after making controversial remarks during a public event. The official, who remains unnamed, reportedly made disparaging comments about minority communities, prompting widespread condemnation from civil rights groups and political opponents.  According to witnesses at the event, the official claimed that certain minority groups were responsible for societal unrest and economic downturns. These remarks were met with immediate backlash on social media, with many users calling for the official's resignation and condemning the divisive rhetoric.  In response to the criticism, the official doubled down on their statements, stating that they would not be intimidated by media attempts to smear their reputation with false accusations. They vowed to continue advocating for policies they believe will strengthen national security and restore economic prosperity.  Despite the controversy, supporters of the official rallied behind them, citing their record of tough stances on crime and immigration as reasons for their continued support. The incident has reignited debates about free speech and the responsibilities of public officials in maintaining public trust.\n",
